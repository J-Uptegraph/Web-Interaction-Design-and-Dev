Hey there stranger, here's a little about myself.
My name is Johnathan Uptegraph and I am from Columbus,Ohio.
I am a junior at Miami, and I recently transfered to the IMS Department from Computer Engineering. 
I love to write code, watch movies, play video games and golf.
I recently purchased a 3D Printer over quarantine.
I am really looking forward to this class and cannot wait to add some new skills to my Code Toolbox!
